  Hi! I'm a mathemetician interested in topics in differential geometry and quantum field theory. Currently I am working on problems concerning character varieties of surfaces, in particular Hitchin components and their compactifications. 
</p>
  <p>
  Currently, I am a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig. I got my PhD in summer 2024 from UT Austin, and in Fall of 2025 I will begin a postdoc at Yale.

  <p>
    We define a correspondence between higher complex structures and real representations, and show that we get a map in a neighborhood of the Fuchsian locus.

    The dots in the picture below are elements of the 444 triangle reflection group of length at most 20. The x and y axes are the logarithms of the top and botton eigenvalues of these elements under SL(3,R) Hitchin representations. You can see the dots collecting onto a lattice as the representation goes to infinity. This paper gives a geometric way of telling which lattice point a group element will limit to.

  </h5>
  <p>We use the concept of symmetry gauging to calculate equivariant Verlinde formulas for non simply connected groups.

  </h5>
  <p>
    I gave the talk titled "Universal Higher Teichmuller Spaces" of the 2022 Oberwolfach Arbeitzgemeinshaft titled Higher Rank Teichmuller Theory. You can find my extended abstract at the end of the report.

    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12250">Differential Cohomology: Categories, Characteristic Classes, and Connections</a> (by Arun Debray, Araminta Amabel, and Peter Haine)
  </h5>
  <p> I participated in a seminar on differential cohomology which eventually lead to this book. I gave the conformal immersions talk, so I wrote the first draft of chapter 20, but it is mostly new content now.

    <h5><a href="undergrad_thesis.pdf">Overruled Lagrangian Cones: Origins and Incarnations</a> (Undergraduate Thesis)</h5> 
    <p> Advised by Alexander Givental. I'm not exactly sure how correct it is, but it is amusing to see this material from the perspective of an undergrad. Some of it could be useful.
