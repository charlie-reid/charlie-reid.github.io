  I am PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin interested in differential geometry and quantum field theory. I will be a visiting graduate fellow at Harvard for the 2023-2024 academic year, and will be applying to post-doc jobs this fall.

  Currently, I'm working two general problems concerning character varieties of surfaces. One is to identifying Hitchin components moduli spaces of complex analytic objects, in a mapping class group equivariant way that generalizes the uniformization theorem for Riemann surfaces of genus at least 2. The other is to realize tropical boundaries of Hitchin components as moduli spaces of geometric objects, in a way that generalizes Thurston's compactification of Teichmuller space.

    Below is a picture of the Jordan projections of the elements of the 444 triangle reflection group of length at most 20 as one traverses the SL(3,R) Hitchin component. You can see the Jordan projections collecting onto a lattice as the representation goes to infinity. An application of my paper is a geometric way of telling which lattice point a group element will limit to.

    I gave the talk titled "Universal Higher Teichmuller Spaces" of the 2022 Oberwolfach Arbeitzgemeinshaft titled Higher Rank Teichmuller Theory. You can find my extended abstract at the end of the report.

  <p>We use the concept of symmetry gauging to calculate equivariant Verlinde formulas for non simply connected groups.

  <p> I participated in a seminar on differential cohomology which eventually lead to this book by Arun Debray, Araminta Amabel, and Peter Haine. I gave the conformal immersions talk, so I helped a bit with chapter 20.

    <p> This is my undergrad thesis on Gromov-Witten theory, advised by Alexander Givental. I'm not exactly sure how correct it is, but it is amusing to see this material from the perspective of an undergrad. Some of it could be useful.
